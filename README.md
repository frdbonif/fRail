# fRail
Quick links for train crew and operational staff on the UK's railway routes.

## Where?
fRail is currently hosted at test-frail.fjla.uk.

It is easy to navigate, on the home page there is a button for each Network Rail Route, this is then split into Franchise and then station.  For example GWR Bristol Temple Meads (West) would be Home > Western > Greater West > Bristol (West).

## What?
fRail is a simple set of web pages with links to useful resources for train crew and operational railway staff.

Tiger is used for links to live arrival and departure boards where possible but isn't available for all stations, particularly those operated by SWR.

Traksy is used for links to signalling maps, Tornado is a good resource but is slower due to the fact your Genius login is required for access.

## Why?
For train crew and operational & customer service staff, there is lots of information available to help us do our jobs.  Two very useful resources are live arrivals/departures and live signalling maps.

These are not, however, the easiest resources to access so fRail puts all the links you need on one page, tailored to your location.

Simple is key, many people that would find this useful are not tech savvy and need information quickly, the idea is that a user has one link that provides everything they need as-is with no options or settings.

## Who?
fRail is available for anyone who finds it useful, not just that but the underlying code is available for anyone to use under the BSD 2-clause lisence.

To keep the pages compact and simple, each page is dedicated to a train crew depot and lists it most commonly checked stations and map areas.  If of course you think that the choices on the page aren't optimal then do please add an issue.

Currently pages are available for the following areas:

- Bristol Temple Meads (West) (WIP)

## Contribute
If you think that fRail would be useful to you but a suitable page isn't available then please feel free to create it and submit a pull request.

The master branch is automatically pulled onto the webserver daily so it can take upto 24hrs for any committed changes to become available.

If you don't know how to create a page then just submit an issue detailing what information you'd want available on the page and it will be added if appropriate.
