    <h1>About fRail</h1>
    <p>fRail is designed to be a quick reference website with a basic, quick to load, mobile first interface.</p>
  </br>
    <p>It uses a JavaScript lookup function to allow new pages to be built quickly by those with limited knowledge
         of web technologies.  You can read more about the technical side on our <a href="https://github.com/frdbonif/frail">Git repository</a>.
    </p>
</br>
    <p>The website is updated from our master branch daily.  A testing version is also available at <a href="http://test-frail.fjla.uk">test-frail.fjla.uk</a></p>
