    <h1>About fRail</h1>
    <p>fRail is designed to be a quick reference website with a basic, quick to load, mobile first interface.  It is distributed through
        the BSD 2-Clause License meaning it is free for all to use, modify and distribute.  The source code (HTML, CSS and JS) is available
        on our GitHub or can be accessed using your browser.
    </p>
  </br>
    <p>It uses a JavaScript lookup function to allow new pages to be built quickly by those with limited knowledge
         of web technologies.  You can read more about the technical side on our <a href="https://github.com/frdbonif/frail">Git repository</a>.
    </p>
</br>
    <p>The website is updated from our master branch daily.  A testing version is also available at <a href="http://test-frail.fjla.uk">test-frail.fjla.uk</a></p>
